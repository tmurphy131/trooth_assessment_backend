## Purpose  
This mentorship is about helping you grow in your faith, know God’s Word better, and live out your relationship with Him in everyday life. We’ll meet regularly, study Scripture, and have honest conversations about following Jesus.  

> *“So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, **rooted and built up in him**, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.”*  
> — Colossians 2:6–7

## 1. Meeting Rhythm & Commitment  
**We agree to:**  
- Meet on a **regular schedule** set by the mentor (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or as agreed upon)  
- Meeting length: **{meeting_duration} minutes**  
- Meeting location: {meeting_location}  
- Notify each other at least **24 hours ahead** if rescheduling is needed  
- Absences should be kept to a minimum. Repeated missed meetings without valid reasons may lead to reevaluating or ending the mentorship.  

**Apprentice’s part:**  
- Show up on time and ready to focus  
- Be present — no scrolling, texting, or distractions unless we’re using a phone for study  

---

## 2. Scripture Engagement  
**What this looks like:**  
- Mentor may give Bible passages or chapters to read between meetings  
- Apprentice comes ready to share:  
  - Something that inspired you  
  - Something you didn’t understand  
- Take part in discussions — even if you’re not sure what to say at first  
- Do short reflection questions when given  

**Apprentice’s part:**  
- Read the Scripture (even if you don’t fully understand it yet)  
- Be willing to talk about your questions, thoughts, or doubts  

---

## 3. Growth Goals  
**Together we will:**  
- Set **2–3 personal spiritual goals** (examples: starting a prayer habit, learning forgiveness, reading the Bible daily)  
- Check in on these goals periodically  
- Be real about what’s going well and what’s challenging  
- Try new faith habits — even if they feel awkward at first  

**Apprentice’s part:**  
- Take responsibility for your spiritual growth — the mentor can guide, but you must do the work  

---

## 4. Accountability & Honesty  
**What this means:**  
- Talk openly about what’s really going on — good and bad  
- Keep our talks private unless there’s a safety concern  
- Let your mentor know if life gets hard so they can support you  
- Be open to encouragement and gentle correction  

**Apprentice’s part:**  
- Don’t just say what you think your mentor wants to hear — be yourself and be truthful  

---

## 5. How We Treat Each Other  
**During our time together:**  
- Show kindness and respect  
- Keep phones away unless we’re using them for study  
- Be engaged — don’t leave all the talking to your mentor  
- Handle disagreements or frustrations with respect  

**Between meetings:**  
- Contact your mentor appropriately (text for quick questions, but not late at night)  
- Remember your mentor is here as your guide, not your peer — keep it encouraging and appropriate  

---

## 6. Boundaries That Keep Us Safe & Healthy  

### Physical  
- Side hugs, high-fives, and handshakes are fine  
- No long or uncomfortable physical contact  
- Meet in public or semi-public spaces (church, coffee shop, or home with parents present if under 18)  

### Communication  
- Text/call only for mentorship matters  
- No late-night texts (after 9 PM on school nights, 10 PM on weekends)  
- No personal social media follows or private DMs  
- Mentor won’t share personal relationship drama or inappropriate topics  

### Emotional  
- Mentor isn’t a counselor or therapist — if more help is needed, they’ll connect you with the right people  
- No favoritism or exclusivity that leaves others out  
- Conversations focus on faith and growth, not becoming “best friends”  

### Trust & Safety  
- Parents or leaders will be contacted if there’s concern for safety (self-harm, abuse, illegal activity, danger)  
- Mentor will tell you first when possible, unless there’s immediate danger

## 7. When Mentorship May End  
It could end if:  
- Meetings are frequently missed without valid reasons  
- No preparation or interest in engaging  
- Dishonesty about important matters  
- No effort toward agreed goals  
- Safety or behavior concerns  
- You or your parents (if under 18) decide to stop  

**Before ending, the mentor will:**  
- Talk with you about the concerns
