        <li>Gift Seats can be assigned to, revoked from, or reassigned to different apprentices at any time.</li>
        <li>If a Gift Seat subscription is cancelled or payment fails, the assigned apprentice will lose premium access at the end of the current billing period.</li>
        <li>Apprentices receiving gifted premium access will see this status in their profile and will not be charged.</li>
      </ul>
