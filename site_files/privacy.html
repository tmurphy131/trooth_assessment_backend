      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 3, 2026</p>

      <p>
        ONLY BLV ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile applications, including T[root]H Discipleship, T[root]H Accountability, and T[root]H War Handbook (collectively, the "Apps").
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and authentication credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Information you provide about yourself, such as your role (mentor/apprentice), spiritual goals, and assessment responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use the Apps, including features accessed, time spent, and interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> If you use accountability features, you may provide contact information for your accountability partners.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our Apps</li>
        <li>Process and complete transactions</li>
        <li>Send you technical notices, updates, and support messages</li>
        <li>Facilitate mentor-apprentice relationships and accountability partnerships</li>
        <li>Generate personalized assessments and spiritual growth recommendations</li>
        <li>Respond to your comments, questions, and requests</li>
        <li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities</li>
        <li>Detect, investigate, and prevent fraudulent or unauthorized activity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI-Powered Assessment Scoring</h2>
      <p>
        Our Apps use artificial intelligence (AI) technology to analyze and score your assessment responses. When you complete a spiritual assessment, your responses are processed by AI systems to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Generate Personalized Scores:</strong> AI evaluates your responses across various spiritual categories to provide meaningful insights into your spiritual growth journey.</li>
        <li><strong>Provide Recommendations:</strong> Based on your assessment responses, AI generates personalized recommendations and feedback to help guide your spiritual development.</li>
        <li><strong>Create Mentor Reports:</strong> AI-generated summaries and insights are shared with your connected mentor to facilitate meaningful mentorship conversations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> Your assessment responses are transmitted to third-party AI service providers (such as OpenAI) for processing. These providers are contractually bound to maintain confidentiality and use your data only for the purpose of generating your assessment results. We do not sell your assessment data, and AI-generated insights are used solely to enhance your spiritual growth experience within our Apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting assessments through our Apps, you consent to this AI-powered processing of your responses.
      </p>

      <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
      <p>We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We share information when you explicitly authorize us to do so, such as connecting with a mentor or accountability partner.</li>
        <li><strong>Mentor-Apprentice Relationships:</strong> Assessment results and progress data may be shared with your connected mentor.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability Partners:</strong> When using accountability features, alerts and relevant information are shared with your designated partners.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics, email delivery).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid legal requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
      </p>
