# Spiritual Gift Assessment — Specification and Implementation Requirements

Note: This document defines requirements only. No code changes are included here.

## 1) Overview & Goals

Purpose: Provide a Spiritual Gifts assessment that identifies each apprentice’s top spiritual gifts and presents a tailored report for apprentices and mentors.

High-level goals:
- Implement this assessment as a new template in the application.
- Use the response scale defined below (Likert 0–4) and compute scores per gift (3 items per gift).
- Generate a custom “Spiritual Gifts Report” (distinct from other assessments):
  - Include a short description of what this assessment measures.
  - Show the Top 3 highest-scoring gifts (with tie handling at the 3rd rank).
  - Show a full list of all 24 gifts with score and the gift definition under each name.
- Surface the report in two places:
  - Apprentice Dashboard → Progress section.
  - Mentor Dashboard → Assessments section (report must include apprentice name).

Template identity and versioning:
- Template key: spiritual_gifts_v1 (proposed)
- Version: 1 (include internal versioning to allow future updates to questions/definitions)
- Official assessment: Admin-managed only (same policy as the Master T[root]H Assessment). Published versions are read-only for non-admins.

Submission rule:
- All 72 items must be answered (required). If partial submission is allowed in future, treat missing items as 0 and flag report as “Incomplete.”

Report description (display at top of report):
- “This Spiritual Gifts Assessment helps identify the ways God has uniquely equipped you to serve the church and others. Results highlight your strongest gifts and provide definitions to help you understand and apply them.”

  - Body: brief explanation and link back to the app (if applicable).
  - Attachment filename: spiritual_gifts_report_<apprentice_name>_<yyyyMMdd>.pdf
  - PDF content must match the on-screen report exactly (including template version and date).
  - Delivery via backend mail service (existing email infra), respecting rate limits and error handling.

  ### PDF Design — Header and Footer Style

  Header:
  - Left: App logo (monochrome or full-color, 24–28px height), aligned with page margin.
  - Center: Title “Spiritual Gifts Report” (H1, 18–20pt, bold).
  - Right: Apprentice Name (mentor view), Assessment Date (YYYY‑MM‑DD), and Template Version (v1) stacked in small caps (9–10pt). On apprentice self-view, show just Date and Version.
  - Below header: a thin divider line (#E0E0E0) across full width.

  Footer:
  - Left: “Generated by T[root]H Assessment” (8–9pt, muted #666).
  - Center: Page X of Y.
  - Right: Report ID (or short hash) for reference, e.g., RPT‑SG‑20250912‑AB12 (8–9pt).

  Typography & spacing:
  - Body font: Inter, Roboto, or system sans (10–11pt); Headings: 1.2× scaling.
  - Color palette: primarily black (#000) and dark gray (#333); use accent (#FFB300 / similar amber) for gift name headers and Top 3 badges.
  - Section spacing: 12–16pt margins between major sections; 6–8pt between items.
  - Tables or lists should avoid splitting a single gift’s name/score/definition across pages when possible (keep with next rule).

  Top 3 visual treatment:
  - Each Top Gift displayed as a card-like block with subtle border or background tint (#FFF8E1) with Gift Name (bold), Score (badge), and 1‑line summary.

  Full list formatting:
  - Sorted by score (desc). Each gift entry includes: Name (bold), Score (badge), Definition paragraph(s).
  - Use a small divider or ample whitespace between gift entries for readability.

  Page setup:

- Show latest Spiritual Gifts Report card with: title, date, and top 3 gifts preview.
- Tap opens full report view.
 - In the report view, include an “Email me PDF” action.

Mentor dashboard → Assessments section:
- For each apprentice with a completed Spiritual Gifts Report, list an entry with apprentice name, date, and top 3 gifts preview.
- Tap opens full report for that apprentice.
 - In the report view, include an “Email me PDF” action for the mentor.

Empty states:
- If not yet completed: show a call-to-action to start the Spiritual Gifts Assessment.

## 8) Data Model & API Requirements (Conceptual)

Template:
- template_key: spiritual_gifts_v1
- item_ids: Q01–Q72

Submission payload (conceptual JSON):
```json
{
  "template_key": "spiritual_gifts_v1",
  "answers": {
    "Q01": 0, "Q02": 3, "Q03": 2, 
    "...": 1
  }
}
```

Server-side compute requirements:
- Validate all 72 items present (0–4 integer values).
- Compute per-gift sums (range 0–12) using the MAP above.
- Identify top 3 gifts (with tie handling) and produce sorted full list.
- Store result with apprentice_id, computed scores, and template version.

Result shape (conceptual JSON):
```json
{
  "id": "result-uuid",
  "apprentice_id": "uid",
  "template_key": "spiritual_gifts_v1",
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "2025-09-12T10:15:00Z",
  "top_gifts": [
    {"gift": "Wisdom", "score": 11},
    {"gift": "Faith", "score": 10},
    {"gift": "Teaching", "score": 10}
  ],
  "scores": [
    {"gift": "Wisdom", "score": 11, "definition": "..."},
    {"gift": "Faith", "score": 10, "definition": "..."},
    {"gift": "Teaching", "score": 10, "definition": "..."},
    {"gift": "Leadership", "score": 9, "definition": "..."}
    // all 24 gifts
  ]
}
```

Security & auth:
- Apprentice can view their own report(s).
- Mentor can view reports for their assigned apprentices.
- Admin-only editing of this template: Only Admins can create/update/delete the Spiritual Gifts template (including questions, definitions, and the item→gift MAP) and publish new versions. Non-admin attempts must be rejected with 403 Forbidden.
- Version governance: Once a version is published, it is immutable for all roles except Admin creating a new version; prior versions remain view-only.
 - Emailing PDF: Only the currently signed-in viewer may email themselves a copy. No cross-user email in v1. Requests must be authorized.

Caching (optional):
- Cache computed report for fast repeat viewing; invalidate on any re-submission.

## 9) Acceptance Criteria

Functional:
- Given a fully answered submission, the system produces per-gift scores that match the MAP and 0–4 scale.
- Top 3 section includes ties correctly.
- Full list includes all 24 gifts with correct scores and definitions.
- Apprentice sees the report in Progress; Mentor sees it in Assessments with apprentice name.
- Only Admin users can modify template content or publish a new version; non-admin attempts result in 403 Forbidden.
- “Email me PDF” is available and functional for both apprentices (in Progress report view) and mentors (in Assessments report view), sending to the signed-in user’s email with correct attachment and subject.

Validation:
- Reject out-of-range answers; explain 0–4 allowed.
- If answers missing and partial submissions are blocked: return a clear validation error.

UX:
- Definitions readable on mobile; long text truncates with expand.
- Title, date, and name visible at the top (mentor view shows apprentice name).

Non-functional:
- Compute on server within < 500ms p95 for typical loads (excluding network latency).
- Handle concurrent submissions safely.

## 10) Edge Cases & Rules

- Tie handling at rank 3: include all gifts that share the 3rd-place score.
- If multiple submissions exist, surfaces the most recent in dashboards; provide a way to view history (optional/future).
- If definitions update in future versions, store and show definition matching the version used.

## 11) Internationalization (Future)

- All user-facing strings should be localizable.
- Keep gift names/definitions in a structure that supports multiple languages.

## 12) Open Questions

1. Should apprentices be able to re-take and replace the prior report, or keep history? (Default: keep history.)
2. PDF export needed in v1? (Default: not required.)
3. Any admin review tools required (e.g., export CSV of scores)?

## 13) Implementation Readiness & Gaps (Audit 2025‑09‑13)

Status: No backend implementation for this assessment currently exists (no template, endpoints, scoring code, or persistence artifacts referencing spiritual gifts). This section enumerates what must be added or clarified before coding.

### 13.1 Current Gaps vs Spec
| Area | Gap | Action |
|------|-----|--------|
| Template registration | `spiritual_gifts_v1` not present in DB | Create template record & version metadata |
| Questions storage | 72 items not persisted | Insert as template questions with stable ids (Q01–Q72) |
| MAP validation | No server validation for 24 gifts × 3 items | Add publish-time validator ensuring bijective coverage (all 72 used exactly once) |
| Gift definitions | Not version-bound | Store definitions with version or embed snapshot in template JSON |
| Submission endpoint | Missing | Add POST `/assessments/spiritual-gifts/submit` |
| Retrieval endpoints | Missing | Add latest, history, mentor-access endpoints (see 13.3) |
| Scoring logic | Not implemented | Add pure function to compute per-gift sums & top sets |
| Tie handling contract | Only implied | Formalize truncated vs expanded top lists |
| PDF generation | Not implemented | Reuse PDF service; add gift-specific layout adapter |
| Email rate limiting | Unspecified in spec | Define constraints & errors |
| History retention | Open question (#1) | Decision: keep history (each submission immutable) |
| Open question (#2) | PDF export asked if needed while earlier section mandates it | Resolve: PDF REQUIRED in v1 (question removed) |
| Security scoping | Mentor/apprentice checks not spelled out in endpoints | Document authorization matrix |
| Audit logging | Not specified | Add events for submit, view, email, publish |
| Internationalization | Future only | Define structure to allow locale expansion |
| Response shape | Single list only | Add both truncated & expanded top gifts arrays |
| Performance target | Generic (<500ms) | Refine: server scoring p95 <150ms (no AI) |
| Error codes | Not enumerated | Standardize set (400/403/404/409/429/500) |

### 13.2 Data Model Additions / Clarifications
Option A (Reuse existing `assessment_templates` & `assessments`):
- Store `template_key='spiritual_gifts_v1'` in `assessment_templates` with: version, question bank (ordered), MAP, gift definitions, published_at, is_active.
- `assessments` row: `template_id` referencing gifts template, `answers` (dict of Qxx->0–4), `scores` JSON containing computed structures.

Scores JSON recommended structure:
```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "template_key": "spiritual_gifts_v1",
  "scoring_algorithm": "simple_sum_v1",
  "top_gifts_truncated": [ {"gift": "Wisdom", "score": 11}, {"gift": "Faith", "score": 10}, {"gift": "Teaching", "score": 10} ],
  "top_gifts_expanded": [ /* includes ties at rank 3 */ ],
  "all_scores": [ {"gift": "Wisdom", "score": 11}, ... 24 items ... ],
  "rank_meta": { "third_place_score": 10 },
  "definition_version": 1
}
```

Gift definition storage:
- Table or embedded JSON; if table: `gift_slug`, `display_name`, `definition`, `version`, `locale` (default `en`).
- Use slugs (e.g., `music-worship`, `tongues-interpretation`) for stable keys.

### 13.3 Required Endpoints (Proposed)
| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| POST | /assessments/spiritual-gifts/submit | Apprentice | Submit answers (creates new assessment) |
| GET | /assessments/spiritual-gifts/latest | Apprentice | Latest own report (scores JSON) |
| GET | /assessments/spiritual-gifts/history?limit=N&cursor=... | Apprentice | Paginated history |
| GET | /assessments/spiritual-gifts/{apprentice_id}/latest | Mentor | Latest for assigned apprentice |
| GET | /assessments/spiritual-gifts/{apprentice_id}/history | Mentor | History (authorization check) |
| GET | /admin/assessments/spiritual-gifts/template | Admin | Fetch active template/version |
| POST | /admin/assessments/spiritual-gifts/template | Admin | Create draft/new version (unpublished) |
| POST | /admin/assessments/spiritual-gifts/template/publish | Admin | Validate + publish version |
| POST | /assessments/spiritual-gifts/{assessment_id}/email-pdf | Apprentice/Mentor | Email own copy (rate-limited) |

### 13.4 Scoring & Ordering Contract
- Validation: All 72 distinct question keys present; each value integer 0–4. Reject otherwise (400 `INVALID_ANSWERS`).
- Per-gift sum: Sum three mapped items (no weighting). Range 0–12.
- Expanded Top Gifts: Include all gifts whose score ≥ score_of_rank_3.
- Truncated Top Gifts: First three after sorting by (score DESC, gift_slug ASC) — used for dashboard card previews.
- Sorting rule globally: (score DESC, gift_slug ASC) for deterministic display.

### 13.5 Tie Handling Clarification
- Report detail uses `top_gifts_expanded` (may exceed 3 if ties at rank 3).
- Featured progress card uses `top_gifts_truncated` (exactly 3 max; no tie expansion).

### 13.6 Security & Authorization Matrix
| Role | Submit | View Own | View Apprentice | Publish Template | Email Self | Email Apprentice |
|------|--------|----------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|
| Apprentice | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | N/A |
| Mentor | No | N/A | Yes (assigned only) | No | Yes (mentor gets their copy of apprentice report) | No (no direct send-to-apprentice) |
| Admin | (Optional) | Any | Any | Yes | Yes | No |

### 13.7 Email & Rate Limiting
- Limit: 5 emails per user (role perspective) per hour for this assessment type.
- Error: 429 with JSON `{ "error":"RATE_LIMIT", "retry_after_seconds": 900 }`.
- Subject pattern already defined; ensure consistent with Master assessment format.

### 13.8 Logging / Audit Events
- `spiritual_gifts_submit` (apprentice_id, assessment_id, version)
- `spiritual_gifts_view` (viewer_id, assessment_id)
- `spiritual_gifts_email_request` (requestor_id, assessment_id)
- `spiritual_gifts_template_publish` (admin_id, new_version)

### 13.9 Performance Targets
- Scoring computation: p95 < 150ms (in-memory arithmetic only).
- Latest retrieval (warm cache): < 50ms server processing.

### 13.10 Error Codes & Responses
| Code | Scenario | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 400 | Missing/invalid answers | Include list of offending question keys |
| 403 | Unauthorized role/action | Mentor viewing non‑assigned apprentice |
| 404 | Report/template not found | Distinguish `REPORT_NOT_FOUND` vs `TEMPLATE_NOT_FOUND` |
| 409 | Publish conflict | A published active version already exists (requires explicit retire or version bump) |
| 429 | Rate limit | See section 13.7 |
| 500 | Unexpected | Log correlation id |

### 13.11 History & Versioning
- Each submission creates immutable record; history endpoints paginate by `created_at DESC`.
- Definitions and MAP resolved at scoring time; store `definition_version` with scores JSON to guarantee replay fidelity.

### 13.12 Internationalization Preparation
- Gift definitions data model should allow multiple locales: future endpoint filter `?locale=en` (fallback to default).

### 13.13 Sample Deterministic Test Vector
Add Appendix B (future) with: (a) canonical answer set, (b) expected per-gift scores, (c) expected ordering — used for automated regression tests.

### 13.14 Implementation Checklist (Pre‑Code)
- [ ] Insert template & 72 questions.
- [ ] Implement MAP validator.
- [ ] Implement scoring function + unit tests.
- [ ] Implement submission + retrieval endpoints.
- [ ] Add PDF generation adapter (reuse styling guidelines).
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware rule.
- [ ] Add audit logging hooks.
- [ ] Add history pagination logic.
- [ ] Add deterministic ordering tests (ties scenario).
- [ ] Add email integration test (subject, attachment naming).
- [ ] Add migration/backfill script if needed for gift slugs.

### 13.15 Resolved / Updated Open Questions
| Original Question | Resolution |
|-------------------|------------|
| #1 Retake vs replace | Keep history (immutable; latest surfaced) |
| #2 PDF export needed? | Yes, required in v1 (sections 6 & 13). Remove from open list |
| #3 Admin review tools (CSV)? | Still open (future) |

### 14 Frontend: pre‑assessment disclaimer dialog before entering the spiritual gifts flow
This assessment works best when you respond based on your current reality, not your aspirations. If asked about prayer, answer how you actually pray now, not how you wish you prayed. Choose responses that reflect what comes naturally to you, not what you think sounds more spiritual. Avoid "should" thinking—focus on your genuine patterns and experiences. There are no right or wrong answers, only an opportunity to discover how God has uniquely gifted you.

### 15 Operational: Migration & Seeding Runbook (v1)

This section captures the concrete operational steps required to provision and maintain the Spiritual Gifts assessment (version 1) using the new `question_code` approach.

#### 15.1 Prerequisites
- Alembic migration `20250915_add_question_code` applied (adds `question_code` to `questions`).
- Python env with dependencies installed (`requirements.txt`).
- `DATABASE_URL` exported or passed via `--url`.
- Definitions JSON: `scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json` present and validated.

#### 15.2 Environment Setup
```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/yourdb
alembic upgrade head
```

Verify schema:
```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "\d+ questions" | grep question_code
```

#### 15.3 First-Time Seed (Definitions + Questions, Unpublished)
```bash
python scripts/seed_spiritual_gifts.py \
  --version 1 \
  --file scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json \
  --seed-questions
```

Expected log highlights:
- Inserted gift definitions
- Inserted question Q01..Q72
- Template has all 72 questions linked ✅

#### 15.4 Publish Template
```bash
python scripts/seed_spiritual_gifts.py \
  --version 1 \
  --file scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json \
  --seed-questions --publish
```

#### 15.5 Idempotency / Verification (No Writes)
```bash
python scripts/seed_spiritual_gifts.py \
  --version 1 \
  --file scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json \
  --seed-questions --verify-only
```

#### 15.6 Dry Run (Preview Changes Only)
```bash
python scripts/seed_spiritual_gifts.py \
  --version 1 \
  --file scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json \
  --seed-questions --dry-run
```

#### 15.7 Force Re-link (If Ordering/Links Corrupted)
```bash
python scripts/seed_spiritual_gifts.py \
  --version 1 \
  --file scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json \
  --seed-questions --force-relink
```

#### 15.8 Text Update Workflow
1. Modify wording in `app/core/spiritual_gifts_map.py`.
2. Run without flag to see warnings:
   ```bash
   python scripts/seed_spiritual_gifts.py --version 1 --file scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json --seed-questions
   ```
3. Apply updates intentionally:
   ```bash
   python scripts/seed_spiritual_gifts.py --version 1 --file scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json --seed-questions --allow-text-update
   ```

#### 15.9 Replace Definitions (Rare)
```bash
python scripts/seed_spiritual_gifts.py \
  --version 1 \
  --file scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json \
  --replace
```
(Add `--seed-questions` if you also want a linkage verification in the same run.)

#### 15.10 Full One-Liner (Fresh Env, Publish Immediately)
```bash
python scripts/seed_spiritual_gifts.py --version 1 --file scripts/spiritual_gift_definitions_v1.json --seed-questions --publish
```

#### 15.11 Post-Seed Verification SQL (Optional)
```sql
-- Count coded questions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions WHERE question_code IS NOT NULL;

-- Ensure 72 distinct codes
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT question_code) FROM questions;

-- Linkage count for template v1
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM assessment_template_questions tq
JOIN assessment_templates t ON t.id = tq.template_id
WHERE t.name = 'Spiritual Gifts Assessment' AND t.version = 1;

-- Detect missing codes
WITH expected AS (
  SELECT unnest(ARRAY[
    'Q01','Q02','Q03','Q04','Q05','Q06','Q07','Q08','Q09','Q10','Q11','Q12','Q13','Q14','Q15','Q16','Q17','Q18','Q19','Q20','Q21','Q22','Q23','Q24','Q25','Q26','Q27','Q28','Q29','Q30','Q31','Q32','Q33','Q34','Q35','Q36','Q37','Q38','Q39','Q40','Q41','Q42','Q43','Q44','Q45','Q46','Q47','Q48','Q49','Q50','Q51','Q52','Q53','Q54','Q55','Q56','Q57','Q58','Q59','Q60','Q61','Q62','Q63','Q64','Q65','Q66','Q67','Q68','Q69','Q70','Q71','Q72'
  ]) AS code
)
SELECT code FROM expected e LEFT JOIN questions q ON q.question_code = e.code WHERE q.id IS NULL;
```

#### 15.12 Integrity Contract
- Exactly 72 `question_code` values exist; all unique.
- Each code appears exactly once in the template linkage for version 1.
- `MAP` (in `app/core/spiritual_gifts_map.py`) covers every code exactly once (validated on import).

#### 15.13 Troubleshooting
| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Missing template warning on `--verify-only` | Template not yet created | Run without `--verify-only` first to create | 
| Duplicate code constraint error | Manual insert bypassed script | Delete offending row or adjust code; re-run seed |
| Drift warning (text) | Wording changed in constants | Re-run with `--allow-text-update` if intentional |
| Link count != 72 | Partial deletion/manual edits | Use `--force-relink` |
| Missing codes in SQL check | Migration/seed aborted mid-run | Re-run seed with `--seed-questions` |

#### 15.14 Future Versioning (v2+ Outline)
- Create new constants file segment (or new list) with `Q73+` or reuse codes only if semantics unchanged.
- Add new migration only if schema changes (not required for content-only version bump).
- Publish v2 template; keep v1 active for historical reports.
